Quantum+HPC uptake project between Pawsey and Melbourne University

## Overview

# Blade design

The design intent will be focusing on high-speed low-pressure turbine cascades.
High-speed designs are promising candidates to be used in next-generation geared turbofans and open rotor configurations.
Whilst they are tricky to design, they do show very interesting physics, e.g. shock boundary layer interactions.
Focusing on this design intent makes it a bit harder but also creates an engine-relevant environment.
